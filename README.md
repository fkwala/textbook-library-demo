# Textbook Rental Service üìñ

### ***Features*** of the Application ‚ùó 
This application is a virtual library application that integrates technology into the real-life library services. Just 
like how a library operates, the application has **2** main functions: **Donation** or **Loan**. The application allows students 
to donate their textbooks to the textbook collection. More importantly, the application also allows students to search 
for specific textbooks in the database and borrow the books (subject to availability).
